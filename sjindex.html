            <h2><strong>Welcome!</strong></h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to <strong><em>Eat Like A Girl!</em></strong> This is food blog where you can find recipes from around the world.
              Coming from different cultures ourselves, we bring diversity and distinctive ideas straight to your tastebuds.
              Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
              Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
              drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
              have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
              nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
              spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
              neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
              opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.</p>
              <p>------------------</p>
              <p>The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
              their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't
              think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.
              Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
              in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her
              sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was
              possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would
              say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the
              Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.</p>
